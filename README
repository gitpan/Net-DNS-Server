Net::DNS::Server
================

This is a simple infrastructure for building "programatic" DNS
servers. This would be a DNS server that can construct an answer based
on a query. 

This module works in tandem with Net::DNS::Method.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

Complete documentation is included in this package, accessible through
perldoc.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Net::DNS
   Net::DNS::Method
   File::Find

This module is currently maintained under Perl 5.6.x. While it may run
under earlier Perls with slight modifications, support under such old
environments might be more complicated for the author. Seriously, you
should be thinking about upgrading. Really.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have no control on the machanisms involved in the storage or
transport of this distribution.  This means that I cannot guarantee
that the distribution you have in your hands is indeed, the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

You should have a file with the extension ".asc" along the .tar.gz
uploaded to CPAN.  This contains a GPG "detached signature" that makes
it impossible for anybody to alter this distribution.  If security is
of any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file
and contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.

You can find more information about this at the following URL

This information includes the correct keys, fingerprints, etc. Note
that this README file should also be signed.
