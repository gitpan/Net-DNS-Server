Net::DNS::Server
================

This is a simple infrastructure for building "programatic" DNS
servers. This would be a DNS server that can construct an answer based
on the received query and on a chunk of Perl code.

An example where this is useful, is the scenario where very large
network ranges need to have a generic naming based on the IP
address. This approach wastes very little space, as the response can
be crafted on the fly by a simple Perl expression.

This module works in tandem with Net::DNS::Method.
